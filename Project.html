		<h2> <a name="synopsis">Synopsis</a>
		</h2>
			<p>Purple Hibiscus is set in postcolonial Nigeria, a country beset by political instability and economic difficulties. 
				The central character is Kambili Achike, a member of a wealthy family dominated by her devoutly Catholic father, Eugene. The story is told from Kambili's point of view and is primarily about the 
				disintegration of her family unit and her struggle to grow to maturity. A key period is the time Kambili and her brother Jaja spend at their aunt's house.
				 Their aunt's household offers a marked contrast from what Kambili and Jaja are used to.

			<!--Blockquote.From the book-->
			<blockquote>
				<p> <em>"I looked down at the jollof rice, fried plantains and half of a drumstick on my plate and tried to concentrate, tried to get the food down. 
				The plates too, were mismatched. Chima and Obiora used plastic ones while the rest of us had plain glass plates, bereft of dainty flowers or silver lines.
				 Laughter floated over my head. Words spurted from everyone, often not seeking and not getting any response. 
				  We always spoke with a purpose back home, especially at the table, but my cousins seemed to speak and speak and speak.</em>" 
				 </p>
				 
			</blockquote>
			<!--End of blockquote-->
			<p>It practices a completely different form of Catholicism, making for a happy, liberal place that encourages its
				members to be inquisitive, form their own opinions and speak their minds. In this nurturing environment, both
				Kambili and Jaja become more open and more able to form and voice their opinions. </p>
				
			<p>Eugene is later poisoned by his wife, Beatrice and Jaja takes the blame for the crime and ends up in prison.
				The novel ends almost three years after these events. Kambili has become a young woman of eighteen, more 
				confident than before, while her brother Jaja is about to be released from prison. </p>
